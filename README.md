# LLM-RAG-sandbox

Welcome to the **LLM-RAG-Sandbox** repository! This project offers a comprehensive exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with efficient retrieval mechanisms to enhance response accuracy and relevance.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a distinct aspect of RAG:

1. **Basic_RAG.ipynb**: Introduces the foundational concepts of RAG, demonstrating how to combine LLMs with retrieval systems to ground responses in external data.

2. **Indexing_in_RAG_for_efficient_Retrieval.ipynb**: Explores various indexing strategies to structure external data, facilitating efficient and rapid retrieval during query processing.

3. **RAG_Query_Transformation.ipynb**: Delves into techniques for query transformation, including multi-query generation and query decomposition, to enhance retrieval accuracy.

4. **Routing_in_RAG.ipynb**: Discusses methods for directing queries to appropriate data sources, employing logical and semantic routing to optimize retrieval pathways.

5. **Re-rank_Non-linear_RAG_flow.ipynb**: Examines re-ranking methodologies and non-linear retrieval processes to prioritize and refine the relevance of retrieved documents.

6. **finetuning_Qlora_mlflow.ipynb**: Provides insights into fine-tuning LLMs using QLoRA and tracking experiments with MLflow to enhance model performance in RAG applications.

## Learning Objectives

By engaging with the materials in this repository, you will:

- **Understand RAG Fundamentals**: Learn how integrating retrieval mechanisms with LLMs can mitigate issues like hallucinations and knowledge cutoffs.

- **Implement Efficient Indexing**: Gain hands-on experience in structuring data for swift and relevant retrieval.

- **Enhance Query Processing**: Master techniques to transform and route queries, ensuring they access the most pertinent data sources.

- **Optimize Retrieval Pipelines**: Explore advanced methods like re-ranking and non-linear retrieval flows to improve the quality of generated responses.

- **Fine-Tune LLMs for RAG**: Learn to adapt large language models to specific datasets and tasks, improving their effectiveness in retrieval-augmented scenarios.
